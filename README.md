# AWS WAF Serverless Services SAM Template

This repository contains an AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) template demonstrating how to secure serverless applications using AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) with various AWS services like API Gateway, CloudFront, Cognito, Application Load Balancer, App Runner, and AppSync.

AWS WAF helps protect your serverless applications from common threats like DDoS attacks, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS). The template includes examples of IP-based rules and custom rules, showing how to effectively limit access and secure your serverless applications.

This Repository is for the blog post - [Protecting Serverless Applications with AWS WAF](https://www.antstack.com/blog/protecting-serverless-applications-with-aws-waf/)
